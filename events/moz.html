                        The first day had a great participation, it included the introductory sessions.<br>
                        The session on first day included :-<br>1. Introduction to FSA and IIT KGP Firefox Club by FSA Devavrat <br>
                        2. Introduction to Mozilla by Gautham Raj <br>3. How to be a part of Mozilla and contribute to it – by Saurabh <br>
                        4. Session on Webmaker by Gautham Raj <br>5. Session on Localizer by Biraj <br>
                        6. Session about Mozilla Code base by Saurabh<br>7. Session about Firefox OS App development by Biraj and Sumantro
                    <br><br>The next day was focused on bugzilla and hands on for localizer and Webmaker. On the Second day Manish,
                        Saurabh, Sankha, Sayak, Soumya, Sumantro, Biraj and Umesh interacted with the participants guiding them
                        on how to start contributing to mozilla. We also had community lunch with the speakers, FSA’s and the
                        participants. And so ended our first event at IIT Kharagpur, which brought opportunity not only to
                        learn a lot but also to meet a lot of new and awesome people. We would like to thank all the Speakers
                        and FSA’s without whose efforts it would have not been possible.</p>
