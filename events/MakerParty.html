          <p>It was the autumn semester and the campus was bustling wit freshmens. We took this opportunity to introduce them to Firefox club and had a small maker party on 19 August, 2014. 
          <br>
          <br>
The response we got was amazing, we had to accommodate more than 160 freshmen in a 80 student capacity lab and the corridor outside was still jam packed. 
<br><br>
The event started with the introduction of the club followed by a workshop on HTML. We had to send many of the participants after the introduction because there was just not enough computers to cater to all those in the room even on sharing basis. We introduced webmaker tools like thimble and x-ray goggles to the participants and also opened the thimbles so made up for submission .
