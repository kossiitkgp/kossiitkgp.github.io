                    <p>KOSS had held an Android workshop under the Google's course of Udacity where the aim was to
                        teach the participants and students the basics of Android, along with data structures and algorithms.
                    <br><br>The entire session was broken into 4-5 modules, each module covering a specific topic along
                        with an assignment relevant to that topic.<br><br>The first session included a rudimentary
                        introduction to Java as a programming language and its comparison with C, the former being
                        an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language. It also dealt with basics of Android, namely
                        how to create a project, run an app, and build a simple user interface. The details of Android
                        lifecycle with regards to starting, pausing and resuming, stopping and restarting and recreating
                        an Activity was also emphasized along with intents.<br><br>The relevant links are given below:
                    <br><br>The second session covered the following topics â€“ hash set, hash map, arraylists and binary
                        search along with some information on stacks and queues and games based on them.<br><br>
                        The third session focused more on advanced data structures, namely binary trees (including
                        binary search trees), heaps, tries and priority queues and their implementation.<br><br>
                        The fourth session dealt more exclusively on graphs and their implementation,
                        specially A* search and the puzzle game that required the use of the same.<br><br>
                        The fifth session involved a run-through of all the puzzles and apps made and fixing the bugs (if any).
